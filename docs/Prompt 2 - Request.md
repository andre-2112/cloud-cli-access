# Role: You are a senior software engineer.

# Goal: Complete the following tasks related to the CCA project.

# Task 1 

Where is this /tmp dir you have been using? local machine or where? provide the full path.

# Task 2 

Make a complete list of all files created locally in this session and move them to the current CCA directory (~/Workspace/CCA). Create subdirectories if necessary (for the tmp directory, the ccc-cli directory or anything else).

# Task 3

# Task 4

Tag each of the resource in the document above, with the key-value pair project=CCA.

# Task 5

Can this infrastructure be used not only for the authentication of a CLI tool but also for authentication of a REST API client?  Can you generate a document under CCA/docs, detailing the workflow and its configuration?

# Task 6 

If we put the ccc cli tool on github, would we be able to configure github actions, so the ccc tool is executed from github, instead of locally? Can you generate a document under CCA/docs, detailing the workflow and its configuration?

# Task 7

Create a new document with the instructions to set up a custom domain for the html form being hosted on S3. Also a custom domain for the Identity Center Access Portal URL.
